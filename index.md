### Open Source Software project

[SquashQL](https://www.squashql.io/) is an innovative open-source project that serves as a SQL query engine specifically designed to facilitate multi-dimensional queries within SQL databases. Its primary focus lies in empowering users to perform advanced operations such as what-if analysis, bucketing, time series comparison, and parent-child comparisons seamlessly. Software developers can leverage its capabilities for software developers to build data analytical platforms with valuable insights from complex, multi-dimensional datasets while leveraging the familiarity and power of SQL. It opens up new possibilities for in-depth data exploration and decision-making.

### Tools
- [GitHub Packages Manager](https://paulbares.github.io/github-packages-manager/) 

> github-packages-manager is a client-side application to manage GitHub packages. It uses GitHub GraphQL API to fetch and display the list of packages and GitHub GraphQL Preview API for deletion. Because of it was made for my own needs only, it has a very limited set of functionalities.
> It may be very useful for Java projects managed with maven having multi modules hence multiple Java artifacts.
